    "# Leetcode Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "* This covers what I have learnt from doing the Leetcode 150 and other problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### Array/String\n",
    "\n",
    "1. given 2 sorted arrays, merge them into 1 sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * start with 2 pointers, 1 at the end of each list and compare the values.\n",
    "2. given a array and you want to remove all the occurrences of an element\n",
    "\n",
    "   * go through the list and you could create a new list or move elements to the end for faster speed than poping.\n",
    "3. given a sorted list (asc), remove the duplicates (i.e each element should only appear once).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * go through the list, use 2 pointer, 1 to point where the next unique number should be stored and 2 to go through the list to check that the number does not = to the number in pos pointer1 - 1.\n",
    "4. given a sorted list (asc), allow up to 2 occurences of each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * go through each number in the list and check that nums[i-2] is that not number, if not then make nums[i] that number and increase i.\n",
    "5. Find majority element (more than 50% of the list)\n",
    "\n",
    "   * 2 ways to do this: 1 - use a dictionary, 2 - Every time current number is the same as res, we add +1 to majority. If not, we add -1 to majority.\n",
    "6. Rotate array to the right by k steps, 3 ways to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * 1. pop the last add to front (inefficent)\n",
    "   * 2. find new position of the number and store number in new array with new position. new position = (old pos + k ) % len nums\n",
    "   * 3. reverse the nums, then reverse the first k nums and reverse the rest.\n",
    "7. best time to buy sell stock:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * keep track of buy price, if price is smaller then buy price is price, calc profit each time and keep track of max_profit.\n",
    "8. best time to buy sell stock 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * keep track of the lowest price and comapre with price in the list, if price is lower than lower price then lower price = price, if price is > then take profit and lower price = price.\n",
    "9. Jump Game, we can to find if we can jump to the end:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * the goal is length - 1, we can jump, pos+num[x], if we can jump to >= goal then new goal is x.\n",
    "10. Jump Game II (same as 1 but need to find min jumps):\n",
    "\n",
    "    * can use recursion to find the jump or, search all possible between near and farthest.\n",
    "11. h index:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * find the cumalitive sum for each number, then treverse backwards\n",
    "12. o(1) insert, delete and random access:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * cant just use 1 data structure, need to use 2.\n",
    "    * use list and dict\n",
    "    * when removing, move the last element in the list to the index of the val you want to remove then pop, this is now O(1) removal.\n",
    "13. product of array except self:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * need to find the prefix product and the suffix product and multiply them\n",
    "    * have a count c=1, traverse through the list, answer*=c c*=num[x], then set c=1 and reverse through the list and do same.\n",
    "14. Gas station:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * need to find the index of gas station to start so that we can make a loop\n",
    "    * if sum of cost i s> sum of gas then we cant make a loop\n",
    "    * loop through gas and current_gas += gas[x] -cost[x], if current_gas < 0 then reset it to 0 and start = x+1\n",
    "    * this is because if the difference is below 0 then it cant be the starting point.\n",
    "15. candy: find min amount of candy to give\n",
    "\n",
    "    * need to traverse to the right, checking if the right node is > left\n",
    "    * then reverse traverse if the left node is > right\n",
    "    * return sum.\n",
    "16. 3sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * 1 for loop, 2 pointers\n",
    "17. 4sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * 2 for loop, 2 pointers\n",
    "18. 560 Subarray Sum Equals K:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * use prefix sum + hashmap to count how many previous prefix sums equal current_prefix - k.\n",
    "19. Maximum Subarray Sum (Kadane's Algorithm):\n",
    "\n",
    "    * track current sum and reset when it drops below the element; track global max.\n"
