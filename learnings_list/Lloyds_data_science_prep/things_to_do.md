data cleaning - removing outliers, filling in missing values
data visulisation - what to use (histogram, bar chart, line chart)?

## 🗓️ 2. Three-Week Prep Plan

### **Week 1 – Core Data Science Foundations**
| Day | Focus | Tasks |
|-----|--------|-------|
| **Day 1** | Statistics & Probability | Review distributions, sampling, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests. Do example problems. |
| **Day 2** | Exploratory Data Analysis | Clean and visualise data using Pandas, Matplotlib. Identify missing values and outliers. |
| **Day 3** | Feature Engineering | Encoding, scaling, creating new features, PCA basics. Apply on a dataset. |
| **Day 4** | ML Algorithms I | Linear & Logistic Regression — build and evaluate simple models. |
| **Day 5** | ML Algorithms II | Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost. Understand hyperparameters and tuning. |
| **Day 6** | Model Evaluation | Metrics (accuracy, recall, AUC, RMSE). Interpret confusion matrices and ROC curves. |
| **Day 7** | End-to-End Mini Project | Take a dataset and go from cleaning → modelling → evaluation. Summarise results. |

---

### **Week 2 – Data Engineering & Applied ML**
| Day | Focus | Tasks |
|-----|--------|-------|
| **Day 8** | SQL Basics | SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, JOINS. Practice common query patterns. |
| **Day 9** | Advanced SQL | Subqueries, window functions, aggregations. Write performance-tuned queries. |
| **Day 10** | Data Engineering | Learn ETL concepts, data formats (CSV/JSON/Parquet), cloud storage basics. |
| **Day 11** | Deployment & APIs | Learn how to deploy a model via Flask/FastAPI; save models with Pickle. |
| **Day 12** | Data Visualisation | Create plots to communicate key findings. Practice explaining visuals. |
| **Day 13** | Ethics & Governance | Study bias/fairness, GDPR, responsible AI, model explainability. |
| **Day 14** | Case Study | Design a fraud detection pipeline: data → model → evaluation → business impact. |

---

### **Week 3 – Advanced Topics & Assessment Practice**
| Day | Focus | Tasks |
|-----|--------|-------|
| **Day 15** | Clustering & Unsupervised | k-means, PCA visualisation, interpret clusters. |
| **Day 16** | Time-Series (Optional) | Basics of forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet). |
| **Day 17** | Case Study Practice | Walk through a business problem (e.g., churn prediction). |
| **Day 18** | Coding Challenge Practice | Python & SQL timed exercises; focus on clean, efficient code. |
| **Day 19** | Behavioural Prep | STAR method answers; “Why Lloyds?”, “Why Data Science?” |
| **Day 20** | Mock Assessment | Simulate tasks: coding + group + presentation. Review performance. |
| **Day 21** | Review & Rest | Revise weak areas, relax, and prepare mentally for assessment. |

## 🧩 Optional 2-Week Condensed Version
If short on time:
- **Week 1:** Combine Days 1–7 (core DS + ML)
- **Week 2:** Combine Days 8–14 (SQL, data engineering, deployment, ethics, and interview prep)
- Use final day for full mock run-through.

---

## 🗣️ Behavioural & Interview Prep
**Common themes from previous Lloyds interviews:**
- “Tell me about a time you solved a complex problem.”  
- “How do you handle data quality issues?”  
- “Explain a model you built — what decisions did you make?”  
- “Why Lloyds? Why Data Science?”  
- Group exercise: discuss a real-world business case, show teamwork and reasoning.  

Prepare answers using the **STAR method** and connect them to Lloyds’ values: *collaboration, innovation, inclusion, customer focus.*

## 💪 Final Tip
During the assessment, **think aloud** — show how you reason, structure problems, and communicate clearly.  
Even if you don’t reach the “perfect” technical answer, strong logic and business thinking score highly.
