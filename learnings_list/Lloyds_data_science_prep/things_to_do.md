# tips

In regards to your next comment the 1:1 questions were non technical, e.g purely skills based: how have you shown X ....? so prep accordingly for the main lloyds skills and values (you receive this in the preparation pack).


Skills interview had roughly 12 questions: 2 intro, lloyds, motivations Q's at beginning, then 8 competencies - (you Will get an indication of the competencies in the intro webinar thats sent through, WATCH IT!!) and then 2 values questions ( again in intro webinar)

Group exercise had discussion, debate elements and then required presentation to non technical stakeholders (your assessors). You then had 1-1 follow ups with the assessors in a separate room to refelect on performance: would you have done anything different....

Pre work discussion pretty cut and clean: present opinion on the given topic, then be ready to field questions including wider business ripples etc.
