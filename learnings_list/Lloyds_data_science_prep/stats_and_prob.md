## 📈 Key Metrics

| Metric | Description | Notes / Formula |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Mean (μ)** | Average of the data | `x̄ = (Σx) / n` |
| **Range** | Difference between max and min | Shows overall spread |
| **Mode** | Most frequent value | Useful for categorical data |
| **Median (p50)** | Middle value of sorted data | Less sensitive to outliers |
| **Standard Deviation (s.d)** | How spread data is from the mean (same units as data) | `s = √(Σ(x - x̄)² / (n - 1))` |
| **Variance** | Square of s.d, measure of spread | `s² = Σ(x - x̄)² / (n - 1)` |
| **Kurtosis** | Heaviness of tails / presence of outliers | High kurtosis = heavy tails / more outliers |

## 📊 Common Distributions

| Distribution | Description | Example Use |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Normal** | Bell-shaped, symmetric around mean | Heights, weights, measurement errors |
| **Binomial** | Discrete number of trials, must have 2 outcomes | Coin flips, yes/no experiments |
| **Multinomial** | Discrete number of trials, can have more than 2 outcomes | 5 sided dice |
| **Poisson** | Counts of events in fixed time or space | Emails per hour, accidents per day |
