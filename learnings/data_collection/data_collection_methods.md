# Data Collection
- This is the first step in the data science pipline
- We need data to analyse.
- The goal is to collect relevant, accurate and up to date data for our analyses.

## Primary Data
- The data collected from first-hand sources
    - e.g: surveys, interviews, focus groups ...
- advantages: 
    - current, relevant, and specific information tailored to the researcher's needs
- disadvanatges: 

## Secondary Data
- Secondary data refers to information that has already been collected, processed, and published by others. This type of data can be sourced from existing research papers, government reports, books, statistical databases, and company records. The advantage of secondary data is that it is readily available and often free or less expensive to obtain compared to primary data. It saves time and resources since the data collection phase has already been completed.
