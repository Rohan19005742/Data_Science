    "2. Deciding on Important Variables\n",

    "    - Backward selection\n",
    "        - Begin with all variables in the model.\n",
    "        - Remove the variable with the largest p-value - that is the variable that is the least statistically significant.\n",

    "        - This cant be used if p > n because the full least squares model cannot be fit. While forward can always be used.\n",

    "3. Model Fit\n",
    "    - RSE and R-sqaured are the most common measures of model fit.\n",
    "    - In simple linear regression R^2 is the square of the correlation of the response and variable.\n",
    "    - In multiple linear regression R^2 is = Cor(Y,^Y)^2 (the square of correlation between the response and the fitted model.)\n",
